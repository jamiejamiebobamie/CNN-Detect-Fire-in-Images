# Fire-Detection-Image-Dataset

This is the repository for my final project for my Data Science 2.2: Introduction to Neural Networks class at Make School. The final

## Getting Started

Clone the repo locally and navigate to the folder in your terminal.

The project makes use of images and starter code provided by the professor, located in:
    rar_image_files
    image_data_prep.ipynb

The professor provided a roadmap for students to follow in:
    In-class_guidelines.jpg

The main work for the project is contained in:
    fire_image_classification.py

The above file contains lines of code that train and pickle a Convolutional Neural
Network to classify the images as containing a fire (a label of 1) or no fire
(a label of 0).

The trained model has an accuracy of 91%.

Please refer to the comments in fire_image_classification.py for an in-depth
breakdown of my model and process.

## Note

The fire_image_classification.py lacks a confusion matrix, but uses data augmentation to balance the dataset.

#

### Prerequisites

Must have all Python packages installed.

```
Give examples
```

## Deployment

If you were interested in deploying the model (in a web app for example), AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Fargate would be good services to consider.
