# Fire Detection CNN

This is the repository for my final project for my Data Science 2.2: Introduction to Neural Networks class at Make School. The file: **fire_image_classification.py** contains code that trains and pickles a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images as containing a fire (a label of 1) or no fire (a label of 0).

The trained model has **an accuracy of 91%**.

The project makes use of images and starter code provided by the professor, located in: **rar_image_files** and **image_data_prep.ipynb**, respectfully.

The professor provided a roadmap for students to follow in: **In-class_guidelines.jpg**.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo locally and navigate to the folder in your terminal. Type:
```
python3 fire_image_classification.py
```
and press 'enter'.

### Prerequisites

Must have all Python packages installed.

```
Give examples
```

## Deployment

If you were interested in deploying the model (in a web app for example), AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Fargate would be good services to consider.

## Note

The fire_image_classification.py lacks a confusion matrix, but uses data augmentation to balance the dataset.
